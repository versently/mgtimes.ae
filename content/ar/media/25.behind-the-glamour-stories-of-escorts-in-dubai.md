Today we dive into the shimmering, intriguing world of Dubai escorts through an interview with Diana, a professional escort in Dubai. If you are in doubt about whether to do an escort in Dubai - her story will help you decide.


## Q: Can you tell us about your life before you started working with the agency?
Diana: "Of course, it was a different world. I came here from Europe, in pursuit of dreams of a better life. In my city it was impossible to find a job with a high salary, where my qualities would be appreciated and two years ago a friend of mine advised me try yourself as a hostess”.

## Q: How did you transition into becoming an escort?

Diana: “After working for about three months as a hostess, I decided to try myself in escort services. I didn’t know if I would be ok, because the work is very specific, but it was an alternative that promised financial stability. I won’t say that it was an easy decision, but at that time it seemed to me the only way out.

## Q: What was it like when you started working as an escort?
Diana: “At first it was a whirlwind. There was glamor, loud parties, luxurious outfits. But behind the scenes, not everything was brilliant. Several times it happened that I was not sure whether I would return to my hotel, because. there was no opportunity to check customers, and there was no talk of permanent ones”


## Q: How has joining the agency changed things for you?
Diana: “Coming to the agency was like a breath of fresh air. It gave me security, a steady income, and some level of respect. The agency acts as a protective shield in this complex world. I already have almost no random clients, a few regular ones and sometimes I can earn extra money as a hostess.
