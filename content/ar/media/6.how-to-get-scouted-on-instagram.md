## Pick your platform.

Instagram is the most popular platform for scouted models. It's also a good place to share your other interests and hobbies, so if you're not already on Instagram, it's worth getting started!

Instagram allows you to share photos and videos with people who enjoy similar things as you do--whether that be food or fashion or travel. You can follow other users whose accounts inspire you, comment on their posts with feedback or questions about anything from what kind of camera they use to where exactly in France they went on holiday last year (because I know I'm curious).

## Post regularly.

If you want to get scouted on Instagram, you need to post at least once a day and ideally more often than that. Your posts should also be spaced out evenly throughout the day so that people can see what's new with your account at any given time of day. For example: If your account is based in New York City and has a large following in Europe, it might make sense for you to post between 8am EST (3pm GMT) through 10pm EST (6am GMT).

## Have a consistent theme.
- Don't change it up too much.
- Find out what your style is and stick with it!

## Keep track of who comments on your photos and engage with them.

Keeping track of who comments on your photos and engaging with them is a great way to get noticed.

- Who are the people who comment on your photos?
- Who are the people who like your photos?
- Who are the people who add you as a friend?
- Who are the people who follow you (and do they have any other followers)?

If someone has been following me for awhile but doesn't engage with any of my content, it makes me wonder if maybe he/she isn't interested in what I'm posting or might not be as engaged with their account as I thought.

## Use hashtags but don't overdo it.

Hashtags are a great way to get noticed by the right people, but don't overdo it. Using too many hashtags can make your post look spammy and it won't get as much engagement as other posts with fewer hashtags. The best way to find out which hashtags work best for your content is to try different ones out and see what happens!

You want to use relevant hashtags that are popular but not too popular (and therefore crowded), so that more people will see them in their Instagram feeds. This will help increase exposure for both you and the brands whose products/services you're using in photos on Instagram.

## Don't post unedited photos or bad lighting!

There are a few things you can do to make sure your photos are ready for the big time.

Don't post unedited photos. This is a no-brainer, but even the best camera in the world can't fix bad lighting and poor composition. If you want to be scouted, make sure your shots look good!

Don't use filters that make your skin look too smooth. Take care when editing those selfies!

## Follow these tips and you'll be noticed!

- Consistency is key. If you post once a week, or even once a month, it's going to be harder for scouts to notice your account.
- A theme can help people find your photos and identify with them more easily. For example, if all of your photos are taken outdoors during the day, they'll know what they're getting into when they follow you!
- Interaction with followers is also important; try asking questions or responding to comments on occasion so that people feel like they're part of a community rather than just looking at pretty pictures online (which is still fun).
- Hashtags are essential for getting noticed by scouters--but don't go overboard! You want hashtags that best describe each individual photo without being too generic.

## Conclusion

If you follow these tips, you'll be well on your way to being scouted. And remember: the more effort you put into it, the better chance you have of getting noticed!
