description: "If you want to be one of an escort's favorite clients, there are a few things you can do to help ensure that happens.

As with any other service provider, escorts appreciate their favorite clients because those clients show them respect and make them feel good about themselves (and their profession). It's pretty simple: the better care you take of an escort during your appointment, the more likely it is that she will want to see you againâ€”and recommend you to her friends!"

## Tip your escort generously before and after the date.

If you're looking to become an escort's favorite client, there are a few simple things that you can do. One of these is tipping generously before and after the date.

Tip her before the date so she knows that this guy is going to be generous and not cheap. This will help her relax when she meets up with you because she'll know that whatever happens during your time together won't cost her much money at all (or nothing).

On top of this, tip her again after your session ends! Escorts work hard providing excellent service so make sure they get paid for it by showing appreciation through monetary gifts as well as other gestures like flowers or chocolates (if applicable).

## Give your escort plenty of notice before you arrive for your appointment.

Giving your escort plenty of notice before you arrive for your appointment is important. The more time she has to prepare, the better she will look and feel. Escorts can be busy with other clients, so it's also helpful if you give her enough time between appointments so that she doesn't have to rush through anything.

## If you want to eat during your date, allow enough money to cover a meal to your escort at a restaurant

If you want to eat during your date, allow enough money to cover a meal at a restaurant. Your escort will likely be hungry and not want to wait until after the date is over before she eats. If she's taking time out of her schedule just for you, then treat her well by paying for her meal as well as cab fare home (and tip).

## Dress well and smell good.

When you meet an escort for the first time, it is important to dress well and smell good. This will show her that you respect her and that she can trust you.

- Clean, pressed clothes are always appreciated by escorts because they know that if a client is well-dressed then he or she cares about their appearance. It also shows that you have enough money to spend on nice clothes, which is another quality that most escorts look for in their clients.
- Be freshly showered before your appointment with an escort; otherwise she might not be able to get close enough to kiss or hug without getting grossed out.
- Don't wear perfume if she doesn't like it; some girls are allergic! And don't wear too much cologne either--just enough so she knows how hot you think she is (but not enough so everyone else does).

## Don't be rude and don't talk down to the escort in front of other people (or on the phone).

There are a few things that you can do to ensure that the escort will want to see you again. First, don't be rude or disrespectful. Escorts have feelings too and just like anyone else, they don't want to be talked down to or treated like garbage by their clients.

Second, don't talk about other escorts in front of them (or on the phone). This may seem obvious but there are many guys who think it's okay because "they're just hookers". It doesn't matter what line of work someone is in; they deserve respect as human beings and if you treat them otherwise then chances are good that your relationship with that particular person won't last long anyway!

## Be respectful, but don't feel obligated to tell her how amazing she is every minute of your time together.

A good escort is not a servant to be ordered around, nor is she an object for your enjoyment. She should be treated with respect and kindness, just like anyone else in your life.

If you want to become the favorite client of an escort, it's important that you don't treat her like a piece of meat or act like she's beneath you in any way. Escorts are human beings who deserve to be treated as such--you should never talk down to them or make them feel bad about themselves because they're working as an escort instead of doing something else (like being a lawyer).

## Be open-minded and willing to learn new things during the date. You might even learn something about yourself in the process!

escort. Escorts want their clients to feel comfortable enough to share their feelings with them, so they need someone who will lend an ear when needed. It's also important for escorts not only because they want their clients' experience as enjoyable as possible but also because it helps them know what kind of person they're dealing with so they can make sure everyone involved has fun during their time together (and maybe even get more work done).

## Learn how to treat an escort right so that you can be one of their favorite clients

You should treat an escort like a person, not a service. Escorts are people too and they deserve to be treated with respect just like anyone else. Here are some tips on how you can become one of the escorts favorites:
- Be generous. It's only fair that you make sure your escort has enough money to live on after meeting with you. Offer something small like dinner or coffee before booking time so that both parties know what is expected during their time together and can plan accordingly (and also because we all love food).
- Be respectful - Don't talk down at them or make them feel bad about themselves because they chose this path in life instead of having children like other women around their age may do (or whatever else). You wouldn't want someone talking badly about YOUR job so why would anyone else?
