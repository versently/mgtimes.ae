They say that the first impression is often the last, and it's true. Dress appropriately, act positively, and exude confidence. Remember that you set the tone for the relationship to develop.


## Start with Small Talk

A little conversation can be a powerful tool to break the ice. Discussing common interests, recent events, or even the weather can help create a sense of comfort.

## Show Genuine Interest

Clients want to feel that they are interesting to their escort. Show genuine interest in their stories, interests, and concerns. But remember that falsehood will be visible. Make sure your attention is sincere.


## Respect Boundaries
In your pursuit of communication, remember to respect boundaries. Make sure the client is happy with the level of personal interaction. This not only builds trust, but also creates a safe space for future intimacy.
