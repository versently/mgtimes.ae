## Purpose of Escort Casting

Escort castings allow agencies to meet and evaluate potential escorts in person. It's an opportunity for both parties to gauge compatibility, professionalism, and set expectations.
Agencies typically seek individuals who are personable, attractive, articulate, and reliable. They also appreciate individuals who can handle different social situations with grace.

## Presenting Yourself

Dress the part. Wear attire that is both classy and flattering. Ensure you're well-groomed, from hairstyling to manicured nails.

### Communication Skills

Conversing is a significant aspect of escorting. Be confident when speaking, listen actively, and respond thoughtfully. Showing your ability to hold a conversation can significantly impact your casting outcome.

## Professional Etiquette

Arrive on time, if not a bit earlier. It shows you value the agency's time and are serious about the opportunity. Bring along any documents or photos the agency may have requested.

### Asking Questions

Inquiring about the agency's expectations, client base, or policies can demonstrate your initiative and eagerness to be informed.

### Handling Feedback

Receiving feedback, both positive and constructive, is part of the process. Listen without getting defensive and show willingness to learn and adapt.

## After the Casting

A simple thank you note or email expressing gratitude for the opportunity can leave a lasting impression.
