### Classy Jewelry and Accessories
A piece of elegant jewelry or a fashionable handbag can be a delightful surprise. Ensure it's sophisticated yet neutral, making it versatile for various occasions.


### Personal Care and Fragrances
High-end skincare products, or premium fragrances, indicate a sense of personal care. But always ensure it's from a reputable brand to assure quality.

### Experience Vouchers
Think luxury spa vouchers, fine dining reservations, or art gallery memberships. They provide experiences, which can be cherished and remembered.

## Don'ts: Gifts to Avoid
A misjudged gift can become an unintentional faux pas.

### Too Personal or Intimate Items
Steer clear from excessively intimate or overly personal items, unless you've established a deep connection or know the model's preferences well.

### Flashy and Over-The-Top Gifts
Unless you’re confident about the model's taste, it's best to avoid gifts that might come across as flashy. The emphasis should be on thoughtfulness, not price.

### Cheap or Thoughtless Picks
Avoid gifts that come off as an afterthought or seem cheap. This could be perceived as a lack of genuine interest or respect.
