No hotel in Dubai shouts luxury and romance like the Burj Al Arab. Its remarkable 7-star standards are unmatched, making it a top-notch romantic destination. Can you imagine anything more extravagant than being picked up by a Rolls Royce Phantom for a date? The sheer opulence of its sail-shaped exterior to its 24-carat gold leaf interior paints the picture of a fairy-tale evening. Sunbathing next to the infinity pool with a view of Dubai sounds like a dream, doesn't it?
